The mobile application is for detecting vehicle crashes and for providing personal safety to an individual. It detects vehicle crashes through an inbuilt sensor named Accelerometer. Once a crash has been detected, it sends an SMS containing the user’s location to the phone numbers of the user’s choice. The phone numbers are added by the user from the user’s contact list. It also provides personal safety to an individual during the times of crisis by sending an SMS containing the user’s location to the phone numbers of user’s choice. The user can also set off an alarm to alert the nearby people during life threatening situations. The Alarm can be set off in two ways, by the pressing of the power button twice or through the application UI. The application also lists out Emergency contacts that are useful to the user at any point of time.
